Do not panic if you do not fully understand each of the algorithms, as some of them will be dealt with later during the course. This notebook should just give you more insight into how on can code up simple evolutionary algorithms to solve certain problems. Getting familiar with the core concepts will also help you with the assignments in the course.\n",
